The first experiment revolves around the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered or Died) model, a simple dynamical system. In this experiment, the SIR dynamics serve as the ground truth for the macro-level dynamics, while the micro-level variables are generated by introducing noise to the macro-variables. The primary objective is to evaluate our modelâ€™s ability to effectively remove noise, uncover meaningful macroscopic dynamics, identify CE, and demonstrate generalization beyond the distribution of the training dataset. <br>

The figure shows the phase space of the SIR model, along with four example trajectories with the same infection and recovery or death rates. The full dataset (blue area) and the partial dataset (dotted area) used for training are also displayed, consisting of 63,000 and 42,000 uniformly distributed data points, respectively. <br>
